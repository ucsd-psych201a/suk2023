## Introduction

Charity organizations rely on donations to both support their advertised cause and maintain their overhead expenses. However, donors support charities less when they think their donations are used more for overheads than for a cause, a heuristic known as *overhead aversion.* In their paper, *Effects of donation collection methods on donation amount: Nudging donation for the cause and overhead*, Drs. Kwanho Suk and Triza Mudita contribute to research on reducing/adapting to overhead aversion. They do this by administering surveys through crowdsourcing websites, with which they assess the affects of choice architecture on participants' willingness to donate to charity.

In the second of their three documented experiments, Suk and Mudita found that participants donate more money when asked to donate to a charity's cause first, before being asked to donate to its overhead expenses, as opposed to overheads first, cause second. Based on this finding, charity organizations could get more money to achieve their goals simply by changing the order in which donations are asked for. We therefore replicate Suk and Mudita's experiment in this replication to assess the support for their data.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

### Planned Sample

We aim to collect data from at least 140 participants through crowdsourcing methods, to assure we have at least 70 participants in each of our two conditions.Our plan is to terminate data collection once this minimum is met. We also endeavor to recruit the majority of our participants from the UK, as this was also the case for Suk and Mudita's experiment, and a difference in nationality could present a confound. Other demographic information, such as age and gender, will not be controlled for.

### Materials

In order to conduct this experiment, we will create a custom website using jsPsych to administer surveys like the ones Suk and Mudita created. We will create one for the cause first, overheads second condition, like the one in Appendix C from the original study, and one for the overheads first, cause second condition, which reverses the order of the first two questions.

We will also ask participants, "How satisfied are you with your donation?", prompting them to input a value on a 7-point Likert scale (1 indicating not at all, 7 indicating complete satisfaction). This value will be an additional independent variable in a series of regression analyses conducted after data collection.

### Procedure

Our procedure mirrors that of the original study. At the start of our experiment, we state that one fifth of our participants (28 participants minimum) will earn 6 pounds (7.77 USD) upon completion of the survey. We then ask participants to list their age, gender, and nationality, before informing them of the way charity organizations use donations to both support their cause and to maintain their operation expenses. We will also inform participants that some charities receive these two kinds of donations separately. As the last part of the information portion of our experiment, we present a non-specific donation campaign for children born with an arm or leg disability in an Asian country. Lastly, we administer a comprehension check to assess whether our participants understood what they had been told.

Upon reading through the relevant information, participants will be randomly assigned into either the cause first or overhead first conditions. In each condition, all participants are given the opportunity to donate some, all, or none of the 6 pounds they stand to gain by completing this experiment to the donation campaign. Depending on which condition they are placed in, they will be asked to provide the amount they want to donate to the cause first, before being able to indicate the amount they want to donate to the overheads, or vice-versa. Regardless of condition, they will be able to confirm the total amount of money they would be donating to both the cause and the overhead expenses. Participants are reminded that they can donate as much as they want so long as their total does not exceed 6 pounds, and that they can also choose to keep the full six pounds. Lastly, participants are asked to rate their satisfaction with their donation on a Likert scale from 1 to 7.

Upon having collected data from 70 participants in each condition, we will randomly select 20% of our participants to earn six pounds. In accordance with what they said they would donate if they earned the six pounds, we will donate the amount they specified to a real charity organization, World Vision Korea, and send them the remainder.

### Analysis Plan

A series of tests will be administered to our data to match those conducted in the original experiment. First, we conduct a regression analysis to determine whether gender, age, and/or condition covary with the total amount donated. Then, we conduct two separate regression analyses to determine the impact of these factors on amounts donated to our charity's cause and overheads specifically. We also conduct a t-test to assess the difference between the mean amounts donated between both conditions.

We then utilize our participants' self-reported satisfaction in a second round of tests. We perform a regression analysis using condition as an independent variable and satisfaction as a dependent variable to see if the order in which donations are asked for affects donor sentiment. We then add demographic variables and the amounts donated in each condition for causes and overheads to this regression in order to assess interactions between these variables.

### Differences from Original Study

The original experiment was administered as an optional continuation of an unrelated survey. After completing this survey, participants volunteered to take the actual experiment, in return for a 20% chance of earning six pounds. We have chosen not to include this unrelated survey, and instead directly administer the experiment and give all of our participants this 20% chance.

## Results

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.

```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation
#Using jsPsych, we establish a pipeline from our custom website to a dataset that populates in .csv format as results come in.

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions
#We will need to load libraries that are necessary for reading, cleaning, and analyzing .csv data. We will also need libraries for performing regression analyses and t-tests.

#### Import data
#We will import the data using tidyverse's read_csv() function.

#### Data exclusion / filtering
#If participants do not pass the confirmation check we administer before they list how much money they would donate, their results will be excluded from the study.

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
#Each observation will be labeled with a participant ID to eliminate the need for PII. We will need columns in our dataset for the experimental condition, age, gender, nationality, satisfaction, amounts donated to the cause and overheads, the total amount donated, and whether that participant was ssselected to receive 6 pounds or not.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

We will use a t-test to determine the statistical significance of the difference between the mean amounts donated in the cause first and overheads first conditions. We will also use a regression analysis to see if age and gender covary with the experimental condition and the total amount donated.

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long.
